# Bikeshare Data Analysis

## Project Overview:
Bicycle-sharing systems allow users to rent bicycles on a very short-term basis for a price. This allows people to borrow a bike from point A and return it at point B, though they can also return it to the same location if they'd like to just go for a ride. Regardless, each bike can serve several users per day.

## Task:
The purpose of this project is to use data provided by [Motivate](https://www.motivateco.com/), a bike share system provider for many major cities in the United States, to uncover bike share usage patterns. We will compare the system usage between three large cities: Chicago, New York City, and Washington, DC.

## Criteria:
### A- Interactive program
  1- User can choose which data set to display analysis for.
  2- User can choose the month and day of week to display analysis for.
### B- Statisics to be displayes
  1- Popular times of travel:
    •	Most common month
    • Most common day of week.
    • Most common hour of day.
  2- Popular stations and trip:
    •	Most common start station.
    • Most common end station.
    • Most frequent combination of start station and end station.
  3- Trip duration:
    •	Total travel time.
    • Average travel time.
  4- User info:
    •	Counts of each user type.
    •	Counts of each gender (only available for NYC and Chicago).
    •	Earliest, most recent, most common year of birth (only available for NYC and Chicago).
### C- Exceptions handling
    •	The Program should handle any input from users without crashing.
