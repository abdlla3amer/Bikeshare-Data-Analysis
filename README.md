# Bikeshare Data Analysis

## Project Overview:
Bicycle-sharing systems allow users to rent bicycles on a very short-term basis for a price. This allows people to borrow a bike from point A and return it at point B, though they can also return it to the same location if they'd like to just go for a ride. Regardless, each bike can serve several users per day.

## Task:
The purpose of this project is to use data provided by [Motivate](https://www.motivateco.com/), a bike share system provider for many major cities in the United States, to uncover bike share usage patterns. We will compare the system usage between three large cities: Chicago, New York City, and Washington, DC.
